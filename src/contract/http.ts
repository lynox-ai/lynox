/**
 * Cross-repo HTTP wire shapes (money + health) — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
 *
 * VENDORED DOWNSTREAM — edit ONLY here (`core/src/contract/`); the private
 * control plane compiles a byte-identical vendored copy. Changes here are
 * WIRE-CONTRACT changes: each shape below crosses the engine↔control-plane
 * HTTP boundary and both sides must agree on every field name.
 *
 * Golden fixtures for every shape live in `src/contract/fixtures/` — generated
 * from the REAL serializers (never hand-edited; generator refs in
 * `fixtures/README.md`). Both repos' pair tests drive their real
 * serializer/parser against the same fixture bytes, so a field rename fails on
 * both sides before it ships.
 *
 * Mismatch discipline is parse-tolerant-first: when a shape gains a field, the
 * PARSING side lands tolerance before the emitting side starts sending it.
 *
 * This file must stay DEPENDENCY-FREE (pure literals, types, and functions) —
 * consumers compile it standalone.
