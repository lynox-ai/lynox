## 1.3.7 — 2026-04-28

### Added

- **Spawn input validation** — `spawn_agent` now hard-caps caller-supplied values: max 10 agents per call, `max_turns` 1–50 (integer), `max_budget_usd` 0–50, `name` 1–64 chars (no control characters), `task` 1–16 K. JSON-schema mirrors the runtime checks; `additionalProperties: false` on the top level. Defensive floor in `estimateSpawnCost` so a malformed `max_turns` cannot return a negative estimate that would credit the session-budget counter (#198, #201).
- **Canary build CI** — Pushes to `feat/**`, `fix/**`, or `canary/**` publish two docker tags (`branch-<slug>` and `sha-<short>`) without ever touching a running instance. Pairs with managed-side canary pinning (lynox-pro #87) so a single instance can be held on a pre-release branch image while the fleet stays on `:latest` (#203).
- **GreenMail adversarial mailbox fixtures** — broadens mail integration coverage for malformed/edge-case messages (#192).

### Changed

- **Realistic spawn cost estimate** — `estimateSpawnCost` now models output as `OUTPUT_FILL_RATIO (0.3) × model.maxOutput` per turn (was naive worst-case ×1.0), and the default per-spawn iteration cap drops from 20 to 10. A typical 3-Sonnet-researcher fan-out estimates ≈ $2.52 instead of $15+, so legitimate patterns no longer trip the session ceiling (#197).
- **Mail tool hardening** — per-tool rate limits + per-recipient dedup in send paths (#188); persisted default mailbox is preserved when its provider fails to load (#187); Gmail OAuth watcher tightens cursor + provider lifecycle (#185); body decoder accepts more charsets (#189); address-list parser hardened with documented flag semantics (#191).
- **Google Workspace auth** — service-account token cache (#184) + coalesced concurrent refreshes (#182) — fewer round-trips on bursty access patterns.
- **Engine HTTP secret always set** — startup now ensures `LYNOX_HTTP_SECRET` is materialised before any handler comes up, eliminating the rare "secret missing" failure mode (#190).
- **Recoverable tool errors stay inline** — a tool error that the agent can retry no longer fires the global toast; it lives where it happened, in the chat thread (#195).
- **Spawn estimator + iteration cap as named constants** — `SPAWN_OUTPUT_FILL_RATIO`, `DEFAULT_SPAWN_MAX_TURNS`, single source of truth so the upfront estimator and runtime cap can never drift (#197, #202).

### Fixed

- **KG entity misclassification** — single-source-of-truth stopwords + a v2 post-filter at extraction time reject generic nouns and price expressions that the v1 regex+free-text pipeline was persisting; eval on 300 cases at 97.7 % precision / 94.6 % recall (#193).
- **Gmail envelope batching** — fewer Gmail API calls on first-page render via metadata batch fetch (#186).
- **GitHub Deployments tracking restored** — `release.yml` records a Deployment object after the pro-dispatch succeeds; the Deployments page froze at v1.3.3 after #142 dropped the production environment gate, this puts the visual record back without re-introducing a blocking reviewer step (#196).

### Internal

- Spawn JSDocs trimmed (no incident anecdotes); 3-researcher estimate test tightened to a narrow band around the documented expectation; `OUTPUT_FILL_RATIO` renamed `SPAWN_OUTPUT_FILL_RATIO` for prefix consistency (#201, #202).
- `.gitignore`: bench-models results excluded (#183).

### lynox-pro

- **Per-instance canary pinning** — `pinned_tag` column on managed instances; fleet rollout (`startRollout`) skips pinned instances and records the skipped set on the rollout row for audit; new `PATCH /admin/instances/:id/pinned-tag` endpoint to set or clear the pin; `updateOne` refuses to deploy when the new tag would diverge from an existing pin, forcing the operator to update the pin first. End-to-end-validated on staging control plane (lynox-pro #87).
- `pnpm/action-setup` bumped 4 → 6 to fix transient CI (lynox-pro #17).

## 1.3.3 — 2026-04-23

### Added

- **API Store: declarative response shaping + OpenAPI bootstrap** (#140). Profiles can now carry a `response_shape` that deterministically projects, reduces, and caps verbose JSON responses before they enter the LLM history — path-based whitelisting, reducers (`avg`/`peak`/`avg+peak`/`count`/`first_n`/`last_n`), and array/string/body caps. `api_setup` gains `bootstrap` (OpenAPI 3.x URL → draft profile) and `refine` (additive patch for guidelines/avoid/notes/endpoints/shape/rate_limit). Fully opt-in: hostnames without a profile or without `response_shape` behave identically to prior releases.
- **Markdown artifact download + print-to-PDF** (#138). `.md` artifacts now carry a download button and a browser-side print-to-PDF action.
- **Mobile/PWA polish** (#96). Settings page gets a version + legal footer, mobile-only items are hidden when the app is running as a PWA or on narrow viewports, and the stale-bundle toast gets a one-click "reload now" action.

### Fixed

- **Empty user bubbles on thread resume** (#129). Agent-synthesized user turns (e.g. tool_result carriers for `ask_user`) no longer render as blank grey bubbles when a thread is reloaded.
- **409 queue instead of failed bubble** (#130). When iOS Safari backgrounds the PWA, SSE drops, and the next send hits the server's in-progress run, the bubble now shows as queued ("Agent arbeitet noch am vorherigen Schritt — deine Nachricht wartet…") and polls `/run` every 3s for up to 6 min before giving up. Stop and thread-switch cleanly cancel the poll loop via a shared `AbortController`.
- **Orphan tool_use / tool_result sanitization on history load** (#135). Unpaired tool blocks are dropped so the model doesn't stall on malformed history.
- **Abbreviation splitting in markdown** (#136). Strings like "z.B." no longer trigger a paragraph break.
- **Session-expired copy on 401** (#137). 401 on `/run` now shows "session expired, please log in again" and bounces to `/login`, instead of the misleading "API key invalid".
- **Entity detail panel closes on Escape** (#139). KG side panel now follows the same dismiss pattern as other overlays.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-04-21

Two themes ship together: a user-facing **Usage Dashboard** that
answers "how much of my budget is left, and what burned it?" and
a **Compliance & Privacy settings overhaul** that consolidates
data-processing controls (LLM mode, voice providers, error
reporting, data residency) into one tab and swaps tier-based
visibility for capability-based visibility.

### Added

- **Usage Dashboard** in Settings → Budget & Usage. Tier badge,
  period selector (this month / last month / 7 d / 30 d),
  progress bar with 80 % amber / 95 % red thresholds, per-model
  cost breakdown, and a daily-trend sparkline rendered as pure
  inline SVG (no chart library).
- **`GET /api/usage/summary?period=current|prev|7d|30d`** aggregates
  RunHistory into a Dashboard-friendly shape: `used_cents`,
  `by_model`, `by_kind`, `daily` (zero-filled). Instance-scoped
  30 s TTL cache. Integer cents over the wire so JSON transport
  has no float-rounding surprises.
- **Managed-tier control-plane proxy**: `GET /api/usage/summary`
  on managed tiers now calls the control plane's new
  `/internal/usage/:instanceId/summary` endpoint and returns the
  included-credit meter (e.g. "$X of $30 included") with the
  Stripe billing period. Self-host + Hosted paths unchanged.
- **Compliance & Privacy settings tab** consolidates LLM mode,
  voice pickers, data residency read-out, and error reporting
  in one place. Visible on every tier; individual sub-sections
  gate on capability rather than tier.
- **`capabilities.mistral_available`** on `GET /api/config`
  reflects whether a Mistral key is present in env or vault.
  The LLM-mode toggle (Standard / EU Sovereign) gates on this
  instead of the managed-tier flag, so Self-Host and Hosted
  users with a Mistral key can finally access EU Sovereign
  from the UI.
- **Voice provider pickers** for STT + TTS in Settings →
  Compliance. Provider list + live voice catalog fetched from
  Mistral's `/v1/audio/voices` endpoint (paginated, 30+ voices
  today). `tts_voice` added to `LynoxUserConfig` so the picker
  choice persists across restarts. Env-var overrides
  (`LYNOX_TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER` / `LYNOX_TTS_PROVIDER`) render
  the selector disabled with a hint.
- **`RunRecord.kind`** column splits `llm` / `voice_stt` /
  `voice_tts` so the Dashboard can attribute voice cost
  separately from chat cost. `units` column holds characters
  for TTS, seconds for STT, tokens for LLM. Schema v28, nullable
  / default-0 so pre-v28 rows read as `llm` without a backfill.
- **`/api/speak`** + **`/api/transcribe`** now write RunRecord
  rows with the right `kind`. STT uses `ffprobe` on the uploaded
  clip to fill `units` with actual seconds of audio; runs in
  parallel with transcription so it doesn't block user-facing
  latency.
- **Budget threshold toasts** fire in the Web UI at 80 % (info)
  and 95 % (error) of the monthly budget. Deduped per Stripe
  period via `localStorage`, rate-limited to one check per 30 s,
  silent-skip when no budget is configured. Hooks off the chat
  store's `done` event via dynamic import to keep alert code
  out of the initial bundle.

### Changed

- **Bugsink toggle moves from Settings → System to Settings →
  Compliance → Error Reporting.** On Managed it's info-only
  ("always active per DPIA"); on Self-Host it stays the opt-in
  toggle.
- **Settings tab "Budget" renamed to "Budget & Nutzung" /
  "Budget & Usage"** and is now visible on every tier. Limit
  inputs inside the tab remain gated on `!managed`.
- **Vault → env sync for `MISTRAL_API_KEY`** at engine init.
  BYOK users who stored the key via the Settings UI were
  previously silently broken — the secret was in vault but the
  voice facades and `llm_mode=eu-sovereign` override read from
  `process.env` directly. Now synced on init, env still wins
  if set.
- **Mistral voice-catalog parser** matches the live API response
  shape: `items` container, `slug` as the voice selector (the
  `id` field is a UUID unusable for synthesis), `languages[]`
  array, `name` as the human label. Replaces the earlier
  OpenAI-style assumption that returned the 5-voice fallback
  every call.
- **Mistral voice-catalog pagination**: Mistral caps `page_size`
  at 10 regardless of query param. The parser now loops pages
  1..N so the full 30-voice catalog reaches the UI.
- **Managed-hosting compose file** bind-mounts SSH keys from
  `/opt/lynox-managed/ssh-keys` on the host instead of a named
  Docker volume. A named volume could come up empty after
  `up --build`, sending the control plane into a crash loop
  (2026-04-21 incident). Aligns with what
  `docker-compose.staging.yml` was already doing.

### Migration notes

- **Schema v28** (RunHistory): `ALTER TABLE runs ADD COLUMN kind
  TEXT; ALTER TABLE runs ADD COLUMN units INTEGER NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 0`. Idempotent, back-compat — pre-v28 rows read as
  `kind=null` which aggregates as `llm`.
- **Managed control-plane compose**: the first rebuild after
  this version bumps the SSH-keys mount to a bind-mount. Operators
  must confirm `/opt/lynox-managed/ssh-keys/` on the host has
  `id_ed25519` (0600, uid 1000) + `id_ed25519.pub` (0644, uid
  1000) before the first `docker compose up -d --build managed`.
  The old named volume `lynox-managed_ssh-keys` becomes orphaned
  and can be removed with `docker volume rm` at leisure.
- **Capability probe**: callers of `GET /api/config` will see a
  new `capabilities` object in the response. Existing consumers
  that iterate fields are unaffected; only new fields added.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- `ask_user` no longer hangs or crashes when asking multiple questions in one
  call. The old protocol looped N sequential `prompt` events over SSE and
  relied on the client replying with fixed timing, which raced on slow mobile
  connections and silently dropped answers. Replies now use a single
  `prompt_tabs` SSE event + one-shot `/reply-tabs` POST.
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/reply` is now idempotent — retrying after a network
  blip returns 200 with `idempotent: true` instead of 404.
- Passkey setup prompt on the Web UI no longer renders with a transparent
  background (Tailwind class `bg-bg-raised` didn't exist in the theme) and no
  longer overlaps the chat input on mobile.
- Timeout/abort on a pending prompt now surfaces a `prompt_error` SSE event to
  the client instead of silently defaulting the answer to `'n'`.

### Added

- `POST /api/sessions/:id/reply-tabs` for one-shot multi-question replies.
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/tab-progress` for optional mid-batch partial-answer
  persistence, so a reconnect mid-batch restores answered questions.
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/pending-prompt` now returns `kind`, `questions`, and
  `partialAnswers` when the pending prompt is a tabs prompt.
- Engine `Agent.promptTabs` is now wired over the HTTP API when the client
  advertises `protocol: 2` on `/run`. MCP and older clients fall back to the
  previous sequential path.
- Schema migration v27: `questions_json`, `partial_answers_json`, and a
  UNIQUE index enforcing one pending prompt per session.

### Changed

- `PromptStore.waitForAnswer` is now event-driven (Node `EventEmitter`)
  instead of polling every 2s. Sub-millisecond resolution after an answer
  arrives, same SQLite durability.
- `ask_user` tool caps the `questions` array at 20 entries.

## 1.0.5 — Release Workflow & CI Hardening (2026-04-16)

### Added

- **Local smoke test** — `smoke-local.sh` runs Docker Compose + Playwright before every release cut, catching runtime regressions that unit tests miss.
- **One-command release cut** — `cut-release.sh` automates lockstep version bumps, cross-repo PRs, merge polling, and tag creation across core + pro.
- **Production gate** — Release pipeline pauses for manual approval before deploying to production; email notification on gate readiness.
- **Docs auto-deploy** — Documentation site deploys automatically on release via Cloudflare Pages.
- **Cross-repo dispatch** — Core release triggers pro release workflows (website + control plane) automatically after gate approval.

### Changed

- **CI scanner** — Replaced `pnpm audit` / `audit-ci` with `osv-scanner` for more reliable vulnerability detection.
- **NPM publish** — Added `NPM_TOKEN` pre-release gate to catch auth issues before they break the publish step.

### Fixed

- **Migration crypto test** — Deterministic tamper in signature test eliminates rare false failures on CI.

---

## 1.0.4 — Multi-Provider Support (2026-04-15)

### Added

- **Native OpenAI-compatible provider adapter** — Use Mistral, Gemini, and any OpenAI-compatible API directly via a dedicated adapter, no proxy layer required.
- **Google Vertex AI (Claude)** — Connect Claude models via Google Vertex AI using OAuth, enabling regional deployment (EU, US) without BYOK API keys.
- **`llm_mode` toggle** — New configuration switch for EU-sovereign operation: when set to `eu-sovereign`, the engine runs Mistral-only without contacting Anthropic endpoints.
- **Postinstall hint** — `npm i -g @lynox-ai/core` now prints a one-liner steering users toward the recommended `npx @lynox-ai/core` or Docker Compose workflow for zero-config startup.

### Changed

- **Provider stack clarified** — Core now ships with Anthropic direct, Mistral direct (via OpenAI-compat adapter), Vertex AI (for Claude), and AWS Bedrock as BYOK. Managed hosting uses Anthropic + Mistral as native; Bedrock is BYOK-only.
- **CI coverage threshold** — Aligned global threshold with `vitest.config.ts` (65% lines, was 70%).
- **npm publish** — Removed OIDC provenance from the release workflow (operational fix for auth reliability).

### Fixed

- Bedrock 400 error when provider-incompatible `beta` flags were passed through (already in 1.0.3, noted here for completeness).

---

## 1.0.1 – 1.0.3

Incremental patches released without changelog entries. See `git log v1.0.0..v1.0.3` for the full history. Highlights:

- **1.0.3** — Prompt cache TTL fix (`ephemeral_1h` for Anthropic, `ephemeral` for Bedrock)
- **1.0.2** — Prompt caching uses correct extended TTL syntax
- **1.0.1** — npm publish auth fix (NPM_TOKEN with provenance, later removed in 1.0.4)

## 1.0.0 — Initial Release

One system that learns your business — replaces your CRM, workflows, outreach, and monitoring. Self-hosted, open, yours.

### Core

- **Agentic loop** — Streaming tool dispatch with adaptive thinking, automatic retry with exponential backoff, parallel tool execution via `Promise.allSettled`
- **Roles** — 4 built-in roles (Researcher, Creator, Operator, Collector) with tool scoping and isolated budgets
- **Engine/Session** — Engine (shared singleton) + Session (per-conversation) architecture enabling REPL + Telegram + MCP in one process
- **Persistent AI Worker** — WorkerLoop for background task execution with cron scheduling, watch-URL polling, and multi-turn conversations
- **Cost tracking** — Per-model pricing with cache token accounting (write 1.25x, read 0.1x) and budget enforcement via CostGuard

### Knowledge

- **Unified Agent Memory** — SQLite-based (crash-safe, WAL mode) with 9 tables: semantic memories, entity graph, episodic log, pattern detection, KPI metrics. Confidence evolution, memory consolidation, retrieval feedback loop
- **Knowledge Graph Retrieval** — HyDE query expansion, multi-signal search (vector 55% + graph 15% + episodic 10%), confidence multiplier with unconfirmed decay, MMR re-ranking, pattern + episode context injection
- **Persistent business knowledge** — Context-scoped flat-file storage with auto-extraction and selective extraction prompts
